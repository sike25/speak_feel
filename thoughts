On Repetitions.
Do we have to ensure both repetitions make it to the same train-test split? Or not, because they are actually not the same audio file 
(just the same features: actor, statement... which are actually not part of the training).
do we remove the second repetitions? Because Augmentation might be creating even more repetitions (0.0625 chance no transformation is applied at all per augmented file)
On the other hand, we don't have that much data already.

Second.
Do we augment only training data? Or both training and testing. If so, do we have to rethink the split ratio.
We should split data before augmentation. Right? Because we don't want to train our model on variations of the test data. Right?
While I am not sure about the repetitions, I am fairly sure we should split the data before augmentation.
